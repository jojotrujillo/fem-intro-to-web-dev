My React Native project for the React Native, v2 course on Frontendmasters.com

**Notes**

As of Feb. 2023, I'm developing on Ubuntu 22.10 and I'm having trouble setting up [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) for [the React Native
portion of the course](https://kadikraman.github.io/react-native-v2/setup-rn). I'm just going to skip for now but it'd be good to revisit to try and setup a plain React Native project instead of using Expo.
