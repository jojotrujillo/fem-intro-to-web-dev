My HTML project for the Intro to Web Development course on Frontendmasters.com

## Notes
Launch VS Code from an activated virtual environment to ensure it picks up the correct interpreter.

➜ python3 --version
Python 3.10.7

## Commands
-m indicates the following command should run as a module. env is also the standard naming convention for Python virtual environments that's included in most .gitignores.
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate

Upgrade pip
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

You’ll want to store code for reuse in files, while you can consider the REPL more of a scratch area. It’s the place where you can instantly play around and try out Python code.
Open REPL in VS Code
Ctrl + Shift + P to open Command Palette, type in Python: Start REPL
Press Ctrl + D to exit the repl.

## Easter Eggs
>>> import this
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

>>> import antigravity
