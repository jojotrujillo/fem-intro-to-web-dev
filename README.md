You’ll want to store code for reuse in files, while you can consider the REPL more of a scratch area. It’s the place where you can instantly play around and try out Python code.
Open REPL in VS Code
Ctrl + Shift + P to open Command Palette, type in Python: Start REPL
Press Ctrl + D to exit the repl.
