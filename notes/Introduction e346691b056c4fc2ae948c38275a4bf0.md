## Course Philosophy

Starting with plain, vanilla React will not only introduce the basic mechanics of the library, but the idea is to get exposure to the entire ecosystem by layering in the different tools to show us how they make the development experience better.

## Who‚Äôs This Course For?

I‚Äôm choosing to take this course because I want a better understanding of React so I can better support and develop the custom apps we work with at Kiewit. Brian mentions some JavaScript knowledge and some exposure to React would be helpful to start out with.

## Setup

- NVM is recommended to handle versions of Node.js. Node.js version 18.x is also recommended.
