## State & Re-rendering

Brian has us creating the below React component to understand how React re-renders itself based on when state changes. In this example, the piece of state, location, never updates because the state connections, or hooks, are not setup. Brian says two-way data binding in React is not free as in React makes you be explicit on when, what, and how your state changes.

```jsx
const SearchParams = () => {
  const location = "Seattle, WA";
  return (
    <div className="search-params">
      <form>
        <label htmlFor="location">
          Location
          <input id="location" value={location} placeholder="Location" />
        </label>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
};
```

For a deeper dive into how and when React re-renders, refer to Felix‚Äôs article on React re-rendering ‚ÜòÔ∏è

[When does React re-render components? | Felix Gerschau](https://felixgerschau.com/react-rerender-components/)

---

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

// replace location
const [location, updateLocation] = useState("");

// replace input
<input
  id="location"
  value={location}
  placeholder="Location"
  onChange={(e) => updateLocation(e.target.value)}
/>
```

With the revised React example using the useState hook, right away we notice array destructuring coming out of the hook. This is where we get our state variable and an updater function that we can use to update our state variable.

The value we‚Äôre giving useState is its default value; in this case, it‚Äôs an empty string. We‚Äôre using the updateLocation function in the onChange handler in our input element. So the onChange fires on each input which fires off the updateLocation function which triggers React to re-render since state is changing.

## Misc.

- Why do we use className and htmlFor in our JSX? Because class and for are reserved keywords in JavaScript. More info below ‚§µÔ∏è

[DOM Elements - React](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#differences-in-attributes)

- It‚Äôs standard for hooks in React to start with ‚Äúuse‚Ä¶‚Äù So if you ever come across OOTB use‚Ä¶ hooks or custom hooks that start with use‚Ä¶, then you‚Äôll know those are hooks.
- A note on controlled forms versus uncontrolled forms:
