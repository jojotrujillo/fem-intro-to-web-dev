## npm

- npm is used to save all of our dependencies in a project. It contains a lot of open source code used to help us develop better.

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```bash
# Initializes package.json for you in your project
npm init -y
```

## Code Quality

### Formatting

- Not having to worry about styling and other trivial syntax frees up your mind to focus more on architecture and problem-solving. This is where Prettier comes in. We can use the VS Code extension for it and use it in our projects by setting some configuration and defaults.

[Prettier Â· Opinionated Code Formatter](https://prettier.io/)

- Hereâ€™s a quick snippet on how Prettier works

> It takes the code you write, breaks it down in to an abstract syntax tree (AST) which is just a representation of your code. It then takes that AST, throws away all of your code style you made and prints it back out using a predefined style.

### Linting

- The recommended config for ESLint is good to use as a linter without many opinions unlike Airbnbâ€™s config, but both are good choices.

[Getting Started with ESLint - ESLint - Pluggable JavaScript Linter](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/getting-started)

[https://github.com/airbnb/javascript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

- Tip: You can pass on parameters to the underlying commands in CLI commands by using two dashes, for example ðŸ‘‡

```bash
npm run lint -- --debug
```

## Version Control

- Weâ€™re familiar with Git and what it does, but hereâ€™s some good info regarding .gitignore templates and Git docs ðŸ‘‡

## Build Tool

- What weâ€™re looking for out of a build tool like Vite is a way to automatically separate out our source files, a way to include third-party libraries, and a way to optimize our build by minifying and other optimizing techniques.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

- Vite is the top choice of build tool that has retained popularity in the State of JavaScript 2021 survey

## Miscellaneous

- More info on a new term, tree-shaking. Has to do with unused code elimination which prevents bringing over a lot of code that doesnâ€™t get used within components regarding React.
