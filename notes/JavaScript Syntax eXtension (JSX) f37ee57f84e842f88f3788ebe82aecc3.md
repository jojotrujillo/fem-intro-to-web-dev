## Purpose & Transpilation

- JSX simply makes code readable and React easier to write by relaying intent with HTML and transpiles down to React.createElement calls

[Compiling vs Transpiling](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44932758)

Inquiring minds would like to know the difference between compiling and transpiling

```jsx
const Pet = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{props.name}</h1>
      <h2>{props.animal}</h2>
      <h2>{props.breed}</h2>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Pet;
```

## Miscellaneous

- With the new version of JSX, you no longer need to explicitly import React. It automagically does it for you.
- Note that component names must start with a capital letter otherwise itâ€™ll translate it as a web component and not a React component.
